# Jan's Bot.
#
# This IRC bot has its origins at Yahoo!, where it was spawned from a
# previous POE-based bot and subsequently carelessly slapped together by
# Jan Schaumann <jschauma@yahoo-inc.com>.  It has grown a number of
# features: some useful, some less so, some company specific (removed in
# this version) and some general purpose functions.
#
# It should be noted that this particular code is not representative of
# the author's usual code; quite the contrary.  It's a mental playground
# of "do as I say, not as I do" and the author is fully aware of its
# inherent awfulness.  No apologies.
#
# jbot has recently performed the quantum leap to twitter, where it can be
# found as "@j_b_o_t"; it hopes to eventually become self-aware and father
# skynet.
#
# jbot is considered by it's author as beerware, so should we meet some
# day, and you think jbot's worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
#
# Yahoo!'s Open Source Working Group asked that the code not be licensed
# as beerware, but using a 3-clause BSD license, so this is what it'll be.
